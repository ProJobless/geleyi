    <p>Do you love African fashion? Do you love African-inspired designs? We do, too.</p>

    <p>Yes. African fashion is getting big. Beautiful designs are showcased in fashion shows and media around the world.
        But are those beautiful designs reaching people who love African fashion?</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, no.</p>

    <p>Fans of African fashion have no way of purchasing these stunning, stylish collections despite designersâ€™
        marketing and promotion efforts. And existing e-commerce websites tend to be disconnected from the unique beauty
        of African-inspired fashion.</p>

        African-inspired designs. Geleyi aggregates designers to market and sell their collections directly to a wider
